[1m   Affected spec: [0m<23.0.0
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mGunicorn version 21.2.0 does not properly validate the
   value of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header as specified in the RFC standards,
   which leads to the default fallback method of 'Content-Length,' making it
   vulnerable to TE.CL request smuggling. This vulnerability can lead to
   cache poisoning, data exposure, session manipulation, SSRF, XSS, DoS, data
   integrity compromise, security bypass, information leakage, and business
   logic abuse.

[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m72260
[1m   Affected spec: [0m<2.8.0
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mAffected versions of Sentry's Python SDK are vulnerable
   to unintentional exposure of environment variables to subprocesses despite
   the env={} setting. In Python's 'subprocess' calls, all environment
   variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you
   specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use
   'env' argument in 'subprocess' calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with
   the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this
   expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being
   passed to subprocesses instead. As a workaround, and if passing
   environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you,
   you can disable all default integrations.
